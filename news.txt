Naghiwalay sina James Reid at Nadine

there’s a possibility that jadine broke up because of the fans

shit started happening when James got a role in a new serye and some fans aren’t having it - maybe they agreed that this was the best for both of them to have freedom to choose without the love-team & fans meddling

Before this confirmation, some Filipinos cited the upcoming series of Reid and Nancy McDonie, a member of the Korean girl group Momoland, as a possible motive to fuel breakup rumors.
